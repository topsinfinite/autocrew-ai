# Given we have just finished implementing all the phases in the reference implementation plan:

- we've just implemented all of the phases for this feature. Now, what I want you to do is to review the implementation - the actual coded solution - and see if we missed anything. Please try to identify any gaps or any issues related to the implementation not following Next.js and React best practises. 

- Use your web search tool to look up any up-to-date documentation related to any libraries or features used in our application.

- IF no conversation exists or the implementation plan is not clear, then ask the user to reference the implementation in the conversation.

- Your task is to review the code and suggest any improvement based on Next.Js and React best practises. Do not make any code change, just and suggest improvement.
